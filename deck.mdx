# Better Performance with Lazy-Loading and Code-Splitting

Stockholm ReactJS Meetup - September 2018

# About me

üëã I'm Jose and I work as Engineering Manager in Spotify

üöÄ I like building & using web sites with good performance

# Performance in the age of components
---
## What we'll talk about
<ol>
<Appear>
<li>Create a component to perform lazy-loading</li>
<li>Apply the component to other use cases</li>
<li>Loading polyfills on-demand</li>
<li>Existing implementations</li>
</Appear>
</ol>

## Improving performance of our sites by loading only what is needed
---
export default Split

<Image
  src='assets/site.png'
  size='contain'
  width='100'
/>

```jsx
const Page = () => {
  <div>
    <Header />
    <Gallery />
    <Map />
    <Footer />
  </div>;
};
```
```notes
Most times you would include all the scripts and CSS needed to render all sections as soon as the user visits the page. Until recently it was difficult to define a module‚Äôs dependencies, and load what was needed.

- How likely is it for the user to see the header?
- What about the map?
```
---
## How to load only what is needed?
- Track dependencies (YUI Loader, RequireJS ‚Üí ES6 + dynamic imports)
- Lazy-loading (Scroll + Resize listeners ‚Üí IntersectionObserver)
---
## Lazy-loading is ‚ù§ Ô∏è

## Lazy-Loading has trade-offs too üíî

export default Split

Don‚Äôt lazy load above the fold

Lazy load a bit earlier than when it‚Äôs needed

Invisible content in some scenarios

- printing the page
- RSS readers
- SEO

## Compositional Patterns

<CodeSurfer
  title="High Order Components"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/comp-pattern-hoc.mdx")}
  />
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Function as Child Component aka Render Callback"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/comp-pattern-child.mdx")}
  />

---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Our Component ‚¨áÔ∏è"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/comp-basic.mdx")}
  steps={[
    { ranges: [[6, 6], [24, 28], [32,32]]},
    { ranges: [[4, 4], [9, 12], [29, 31]]},
    { ranges: [[14, 18]]},
  ]}
  />
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Using it"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/comp-basic-use.mdx")}
  />
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Stateless Child Component ‚¨áÔ∏è"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/gallery-stateless.mdx")}
  steps={[
    { ranges: [[1, 1], [5, 9]], notes: "Using isVisible ‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è" }
  ]}
  />
---
TIP 
üí° : make sure that you reserve the area for the lazy-loaded component
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Stateful Child Component ‚¨áÔ∏è"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/map.mdx")}
  steps={[
    { ranges: [[30, 38]]},
    { ranges: [[8, 28]]}
  ]}
  />
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Moving state to the Observer component"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/has-been-visible.mdx")}
/>
---
## More use cases

## Polyfilling IntersectionObserver on-demand
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Disabling lazy-loading if IO is not supported"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/disable-lazy-loading.mdx")}
  steps={[
    { ranges: [[6, 6], [12, 12]] }
  ]}/>
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Requesting a polyfill on demand"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/polyfill-on-demand.mdx")}
  steps={[
    { ranges: [[4, 8]] }
  ]}/>
  />

Safari requests the polyfill for intersection-observer on demand.

 No need to ship it to browsers that support it natively.

## Code Splitting, CSS-in-JS & more
<ul>
<Appear>
<li>react-router and Next.js have made code-splitting easy to implement</li>
<li>lazy-loading can be applied to other resources (SVGs, CSS)</li>
<li>With CSS-in-JS we take code splitting further, loading CSS on demand</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

- [researchgate/react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/researchgate/react-intersection-observer)
---
## Conclusion
Componentization makes code-splitting and loading assets on-demand easier than ever!
---
## Buzz words ‚Üí Useful tools
ES6 + CSS-in-JS + bundlers = High Performance Sites
